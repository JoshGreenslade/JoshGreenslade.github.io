<p id="id00044" style="margin-top: 2em">Happily, it is no longer necessary to argue that public speaking is a
  worthy subject for regular study in school and college. The teaching of
  this subject, in one form or another, is now fairly well established.
  In each of the larger universities, including professional schools and
  summer schools, the students electing the courses in speaking number
  well into the hundreds. These courses are now being more generally
  placed among those counted towards the academic degrees. The demand for
  trained teachers in the various branches of the work in schools and
  colleges is far above the present supply. Educators in general look
  with more favor upon this kind of instruction, recognizing its
  practical usefulness and its cultural value. The question of the
  present time, then, is not whether or not the subject shall have a
  place. Some sort of place it always has had and always will have.
  Present discussion should rather bear upon the policy and the method of
  that instruction, the qualifications to be required of teachers, and
  the consideration for themselves and their work that teachers have a
  right to expect.</p>
  
  <p id="id00045">Naturally, public speaking in the form of debating has received favor
  among educators. It seems to serve the ends of practice in speaking and
  it gives also good mental discipline. The high regard for debating is
  not misplaced. We can hardly overestimate the good that debating has
  done to the subject of speaking in the schools and colleges. The rigid
  intellectual discipline involved in debating has helped to establish
  public speaking in the regular curriculum, thus gaining for it, and for
  teachers in it, greater respect. To bring training in speech into close
  relation with training in thought, and with the study of expression in
  English, is most desirable. This, however, does <i>not</i> mean that
  training in speech, as a distinct object in itself, should be allowed
  to fall into comparative neglect. It is quite possible that, along with
  the healthy disapproval of false elocution and meaningless declamation,
  may come an underestimation of the important place of a right kind and
  a due degree of technical training in voice and general form.</p>
  
  <p id="id00046">In a recent book on public speaking, the statement is made that it is
  all well enough, if it so happens, for a speaker to have a pleasing
  voice, but it is not essential. This, though true in a sense, is
  misleading, and much teaching of this sort would be unfortunate for
  young speakers. It would seem quite unnecessary to say that beauty of
  voice is not in itself a primary object in vocal training for public
  speaking. The object is to make voices effective. In the effective use
  of any other instrument, we apply the utmost skill for the perfect
  adjustment or coordination of all the means of control. We do this for
  the attainment of power, for the conserving of energy, for the insuring
  of endurance and ease of operation. This is the end in the training of
  the voice. It is to avoid friction. It is to prevent nervous strain,
  muscular distortion, and failing power, and to secure easy response to
  the will of the speaker. The point not wholly understood or heeded is
  that, as a rule, the unpleasing voice is an indication of ill
  adjustment and friction. It denotes a mechanism wearing on itself—it
  means a voice that will weaken or fail before its time—a voice that
  needs repair.</p>
  
  <p id="id00047">Since speech is to express a speaker's thought, training in speech
  should not be altogether dissociated from training in thinking. It
  ought to go hand in hand, indeed, with the study of English, from first
  to last. But training in voice and in the method of speech is a
  technical matter. It ought not to be left to the haphazard treatment,
  the intense spurring on, of vocally unskilled coaches for speaking
  contests. Discussions about the teaching of speaking are often very
  curious. We are frequently told by what means a few great orators have
  succeeded, but we are hardly ever informed of the causes from which
  many other speakers have been embarrassed or have failed. A book or
  essay is written to prove, from the individual experience of the
  author, the infallibility of a method. He was able to succeed, the
  argument runs, only by this or that means; therefore all should do as
  he did. It seems very plausible and attractive to read, for instance,
  that to succeed in speaking, it is only necessary to plunge in and be
  in earnest. But another writer points out that this is quite absurd;
  that many poor speakers have not lacked in intense earnestness and
  sincerity; that it isn't feeling or intense spirit alone that insures
  success, but it is the attainment as well of a vocal method. Yet he
  goes on to argue that this vocal method, this forming of a public
  speaking voice and style, cannot be rightly gained from the teachers;
  it must be acquired through the exercise of each man's own will; if a
  man finds he is going wrong he must will to go right—as if many men
  had not persistently but unsuccessfully exercised their will to this
  very end. It is so easy, and so attractive, to resolve all problems
  into one idea. President Woodrow Wilson, of Princeton University, once
  said that he always avoided the man or the book that proclaimed one
  idea for the correcting of society's ills. These ideas on which books
  or essays are written are too obviously fallacious to need extended
  comment; the wonder is that they are often quoted and commended as
  being beneficial in their teaching. If we want to row or sprint or play
  golf, we do not simply go in and do our utmost; we apply the best
  technical skill to the art; we seek to learn how, from the experience
  of the past, and through the best instructors obtainable. Both common
  sense and experience show that the use of the human voice in the art of
  speaking is not the one thing, among all things, that cannot be
  successfully taught. The results of vocal teaching show, on the
  contrary, from multitudes of examples, from volumes of testimony, that
  there are few branches of instruction wherein the specially trained
  teacher is so much needed, and can be so effective as in the art of
  speaking.</p>
  
  <p id="id00048">In an experience extending over many years, an experience dealing with
  about all the various forms of public speaking and vocal teaching, the
  present writer has tried many methods, conducted classes on several
  different plans, learned the needs, observed the efforts, considered
  the successes and failures, of many men and women of various ages and
  of many callings. The constant and insistent fact in all this period of
  experience has been that skillful, technical instruction, as such, is
  the one kind of instruction that should always be provided where public
  speaking is taught, and the one that the student should not fail to
  secure when it is at hand. Other elements in good speech-making may, if
  necessary, be obtained from other sources. The teacher of speaking
  should teach speech. He should teach something else also, but he
  should, as a technician, teach that. The multitude of men and women
  who, in earlier and later life, come, in vocal trouble, to seek help
  from the experienced teacher, and the abundance of testimony as to the
  satisfactory results; the repeated evidences of failure to produce
  rightly trained voices wholly by so-called inspirational methods; the
  frequent evidences of pernicious vocal results from the forcing of
  young voices in the overintense and hasty efforts made in preparing for
  prize speaking, acting, and debating,—all these may not come to the
  understanding of the ordinary observer; they may not often, perhaps,
  come within the experience of the exceptionally gifted individuals who
  are usually cited as examples of distinguished success; they cannot
  impress themselves on educators who have little or no relation with
  this special subject; they naturally come into the knowledge and
  experience of the specially trained teacher of public speaking, who is
  brought into intimate relations with the subject and deals with all
  sorts and conditions of men. Out of this experience comes the strong
  conviction that the teacher of public speaking should be a vocal
  technician and a vocal physician, able to teach constructively and to
  treat correctively, knowing all he can of all that has been taught
  before, but teaching only as much of what he knows as is necessary to
  any individual.</p>
  
  <p id="id00049">For the dignity and worth of the teaching, the teacher of speaking
  should be trained, and should be a trainer, as has been indirectly
  said, in some other subject—in English literature or composition, in
  debating, history, or what not. He should be one of the academic
  faculty—concerned with thought, which speech expresses. He should not,
  for his other subject, be mainly concerned with gymnastics or
  athletics; he should not, for his own good and the consequent good of
  his work, be wholly taken up merely with the teaching of technical form
  in speaking. He should not be merely—if at all—a coach in inter-
  collegiate contests; nor should his service to an institution be
  adjudged mainly by the results of such contests. He should be an
  independent, intellectually grown and growing man, one who—in his
  exceptionally intimate relations with students—will have a large and
  right influence on student life. The offer recently held out by a
  university of a salary and an academic rank equal to its best, to a
  sufficiently qualified instructor in public speaking, was one of the
  several signs of a sure movement of to-day in the right direction—the
  demand for a man of high character and broad culture, specially skilled
  in the technical subject he was to teach, and the providing of a worthy
  position.</p>
  
  <p id="id00050">One fact that needs to be impressed upon governing bodies of school and
  college is that the cultivation of good speaking cannot but be
  unsatisfactory when it is continued over only a very brief time. It may
  only do mischief. A considerable period is necessary, as is the case
  with other subjects, for reaching the student intelligence, for molding
  the faculties, for maturing the powers, for adapting method to the
  individual, and for bringing the personality out through the method, so
  that method disappears. Senator George F. Hoar once gave very sensible
  advice in an address to an audience of Harvard students. He did not
  content himself with dwelling on the inevitable platitude, first have
  something to say, and then say it; he said he had been, in all his
  career, at a special disadvantage in public speaking, from the want of
  early training in the use of his voice; and he urged that students
  would do well not only to take advantage of such training in college,
  but to have their teacher, if it were possible, follow them, for a
  time, into their professional work. This idea was well exemplified in
  the case of Phillips Brooks—a speaker of spontaneity, simplicity, and
  splendid power. It is said that, in the period of his pulpit work, in
  the midst of his absorbing church labors, he made it a duty to go from
  time to time for a period of work with his teacher of voice, that he
  might be kept from falling back into wrong ways. It is often said that,
  if a man has it in him, he will speak well anyway. It is emphatically
  the man who has it in him, the man of intense temperament, like that of
  Phillips Brooks, who most needs the balance wheel, the sure reliance,
  of technique. That this technique should not be too technical; that
  form should not be too formal; that teaching should not be too good, or
  do too much, is one of the principles of good teaching. The point
  insisted on is that a considerable time is needed, as it is in other
  kinds of teaching, for thoroughly working out a few essential
  principles; for overcoming a few obstinate faults; for securing matured
  results by the right process of gradual development.</p>
  
  <p id="id00051">There is much cause for gratification in the evidences of a growing
  appreciation, in all quarters, of the place due to spoken English, as a
  study to be taught continuously side by side with written English. Much
  progress has also been made toward making youthful platform speaking,
  as well as youthful writing, more rational in form, more true in
  spirit, more useful for its purpose. In good time written and spoken
  English, conjoined with disciplinary training in thought and
  imagination, will both become firmly established in their proper place
  as subjects to be thoroughly and systematically taught. Good teaching
  will become traditional, and good teachers not rare. And among the
  specialized courses in public speaking an important place should always
  be given to an exact training in voice and in the whole art of
  effective delivery.</p>
